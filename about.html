    <h3 class="title"> Mushrooms Health Benefits</h3>
    <ol>
     <li>Decrease the risk of cancer: Mushrooms are a powerful source of ergothioneine,
       an amino acid and antioxidant that prevents or slows cellular damage.</li>
     <li>Lower sodium intake: Sodium and high blood pressure often go hand in hand.
       Sodium causes the body to retain excess fluid, which can increase blood pressure. 
      To decrease your sodium intake, consider adding mushrooms to your meals.</li>
     <li>Promote lower cholesterol:Mushrooms make an excellent substitute for red meat while minimizing calories, fat and cholesterol.</li>
     <li>Stimulate a healthier gut: The microbiome in your gut is home to organisms and bacteria that play a large role in your health and mood.
       One way to keep your gut healthy is to stimulate the growth of healthy bacteria in that space with the use of prebiotics, such as mushrooms. 
       They're a pantry staple that's ready to elevate your culinary adventures.</li>
     <li>Support a healthy immune system: Mushrooms contain macronutrients that support a healthy immune system. 
      According to the Mushroom Council, your immune system will benefit from mushrooms. </li>
